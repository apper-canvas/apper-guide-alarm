Think of Apper as your friendly tech assistant who can build complete applications just by talking to you.\n\n## How Apper Works\n\nImagine having a conversation with a super-smart friend who happens to be a coding genius. You simply describe what you want to build, and Apper makes it happen. No coding knowledge required, no template selection needed, and no complex tool connections.\n\n### The Magic Behind Apper\n\n- **Natural Language Processing**: Just talk to Apper like you would to a friend\n- **Instant App Generation**: Watch your ideas come to life in real-time\n- **All-in-One Solution**: Everything you need is built right in\n- **No Technical Skills Required**: Focus on your ideas, not the implementation\n\n## Why Choose Apper?\n\nTraditional app development can take months and require teams of developers. With Apper, you can:\n\n- Build functional apps in minutes, not months\n- Test ideas quickly without major investment\n- Iterate and improve based on real feedback\n- Focus on solving problems, not learning to code\n\n```\nExample conversation with Apper:\nYou: \"I need a booking system for my restaurant\"\nApper: \"Great! I'll build you a restaurant booking system with customer reservations, table management, and confirmation emails.\"\n```\n\nThat's it! No forms to fill out, no templates to choose from, no plugins to install. Just pure, conversational app building.",

    "content": "# Why Apper Stands Out\n\nIn a world full of app builders and development tools, Apper takes a completely different approach. Here's what makes it special:\n\n## The All-in-One Difference\n\nMost app builders require you to:\n- Choose from limited templates\n- Connect multiple third-party services\n- Learn complex interfaces\n- Manage separate tools for different features\n\nApper handles everything in one place:\n\n### Complete Feature Integration\n- **Database**: Automatically set up and configured\n- **User Authentication**: Login systems ready out of the box\n- **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration included\n- **Email Systems**: Automated notifications and confirmations\n- **Mobile Responsive**: Works perfectly on all devices\n- **Hosting & Deployment**: Your app is live immediately\n\n## Conversational Development\n\nThe biggest game-changer is how you interact with Apper. Instead of clicking through complex menus and forms, you simply describe what you want.\n\n### Natural Communication\n```\n❌ Traditional way:\n1. Select \"E-commerce Template\"\n2. Configure product database\n3. Set up payment gateway\n4. Design checkout flow\n5. Configure email notifications\n\n✅ Apper way:\n\"Build me an online store for handmade jewelry with PayPal checkout\"\n```\n\n## Smart Context Understanding\n\nApper doesn't just build what you ask for – it builds what you actually need. When you say \"booking app,\" Apper understands you'll likely need:\n- Calendar integration\n- Email confirmations\n- Customer management\n- Payment processing\n- Admin dashboard\n\nAll of these are included automatically, saving you hours of planning and configuration.",

The AI assistant is always ready to help you add features, make changes, and perfect your application.\n\n## The Conversational Approach\n\nUnlike traditional development tools with complex menus and settings, Apper uses natural conversation to modify your app. Just tell the assistant what you want, and it happens!\n\n## Common Editing Requests\n\n### Adding New Features\n\n```\nSimple additions:\n- \"Add a contact form to the homepage\"\n- \"Include a user profile page\"\n- \"Add a search function\"\n- \"Create a photo gallery section\"\n\nMore complex features:\n- \"Add email notifications when someone books\"\n- \"Include a rating system for services\"\n- \"Create a loyalty points program\"\n- \"Add integration with Google Calendar\"\n```\n\n### Modifying Existing Features\n\n```\nDesign changes:\n- \"Make the header blue instead of green\"\n- \"Change the font to something more modern\"\n- \"Add our company logo to the top\"\n- \"Make the buttons bigger and more rounded\"\n\nFunctionality changes:\n- \"Allow customers to cancel bookings up to 2 hours before\"\n- \"Add a confirmation step before deleting items\"\n- \"Make the form require phone numbers\"\n- \"Change the booking limit to 3 per customer\"\n```\n\n### Content Updates\n\n```\nText and content:\n- \"Update the welcome message on the homepage\"\n- \"Add a FAQ section with common questions\"\n- \"Include our business hours and location\"\n- \"Change the pricing information\"\n\nImages and media:\n- \"Replace the header image with our studio photo\"\n- \"Add a video introduction to the about page\"\n- \"Include customer testimonials with photos\"\n- \"Create an image carousel for our services\"\n```\n\n## Advanced Modifications\n\n### User Experience Improvements\n\n```\nNavigation enhancements:\n- \"Add breadcrumb navigation\"\n- \"Create a sticky menu that follows when scrolling\"\n- \"Include a back button on all pages\"\n- \"Add quick action buttons for common tasks\"\n\nAccessibility improvements:\n- \"Make the app work better with screen readers\"\n- \"Increase text size options for older users\"\n- \"Add keyboard navigation shortcuts\"\n- \"Include alt text for all images\"\n```\n\n### Business Logic Changes\n\n```\nWorkflow modifications:\n- \"Send reminder emails 24 hours before appointments\"\n- \"Create an approval process for new bookings\"\n- \"Add automatic refunds for cancelled services\"\n- \"Include a waitlist when classes are full\"\n\nData management:\n- \"Export customer data to a CSV file\"\n- \"Add tags to organize customers by preferences\"\n- \"Create custom fields for special requirements\"\n- \"Include analytics tracking for popular services\"\n```\n\n## How to Communicate Effectively\n\n### Be Specific But Natural\n\n❌ **Too vague**: \"Make it better\"\n✅ **Just right**: \"Add a calendar view so customers can see all available dates at once\"\n\n❌ **Too technical**: \"Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication with JWT tokens\"\n✅ **Just right**: \"Let customers log in with their Google accounts\"\n\n### Provide Context\n\n```\nInstead of: \"Add a button\"\nSay: \"Add a 'Book Now' button on each service card that takes customers directly to the booking form\"\n\nInstead of: \"Change the colors\"\nSay: \"Make the color scheme match our brand - green primary buttons and warm gray backgrounds\"\n```\n\n### Reference Existing Elements\n\n```\nGood examples:\n- \"On the booking form, add a dropdown for selecting the instructor\"\n- \"In the customer dashboard, include a section showing upcoming appointments\"\n- \"Next to each service description, add the duration and price\"\n```\n\n## Step-by-Step Editing Process\n\n### 1. Identify What You Want to Change\nBefore talking to the assistant, think about:\n- What specific problem are you solving?\n- Where in the app should this change appear?\n- How should it work from the user's perspective?\n\n### 2. Describe Your Request Clearly\nUse this format:\n- **Where**: \"On the homepage...\"\n- **What**: \"...add a testimonials section...\"\n- **How**: \"...that rotates through customer reviews every 5 seconds\"\n\n### 3. Review the Changes\nAfter Apper makes the modification:\n- Test the new feature thoroughly\n- Check how it looks on mobile devices\n- Make sure it fits with the rest of your app\n\n### 4. Refine if Needed\n```\nFollow-up requests:\n- \"The testimonial text is too small, can you make it bigger?\"\n- \"Move the section below the main hero image\"\n- \"Add customer photos next to their testimonials\"\n```\n\n## Common Editing Scenarios\n\n### Scenario 1: Adding User Authentication\n\n**Initial request**: \"Add a login system so customers can create accounts\"\n\n**Follow-up refinements**:\n- \"Include a 'Remember Me' checkbox\"\n- \"Add password reset functionality\"\n- \"Let users sign up with their email or phone number\"\n- \"Send a welcome email when someone creates an account\"\n\n### Scenario 2: Improving the Booking Process\n\n**Initial request**: \"Make the booking process easier for customers\"\n\n**Specific improvements**:\n- \"Show available time slots in real-time\"\n- \"Add a calendar picker instead of dropdown menus\"\n- \"Include service descriptions and prices\"\n- \"Allow customers to add special requests or notes\"\n\n## Tips for Successful Editing\n\n### Start Small\nMake one change at a time rather than requesting multiple modifications at once. This helps you:\n- See exactly what each change does\n- Avoid overwhelming the assistant\n- Maintain better control over your app's evolution\n\n### Test Regularly\nAfter each change:\n- Try the feature yourself\n- Think like a customer using your app\n- Check both desktop and mobile versions\n- Ask friends or colleagues for feedback\n\n### Keep Your Users in Mind\n```\nAlways ask yourself:\n- Does this make the app easier to use?\n- Will my customers understand this feature?\n- Does this solve a real problem?\n- Is this change necessary or just nice to have?\n```\n\nRemember: The assistant is incredibly capable, but the best results come from clear communication and thoughtful requests. Don't be afraid to iterate and refine - that's how you build truly great apps!",

    "description": "Master version control - how Apper saves changes, and how to switch or restore versions.",
    "content": "# App Versions: Your Safety Net\n\nOne of Apper's most valuable features is its automatic version control system. Every change you make is saved as a new version, giving you the freedom to experiment without fear of breaking your app.\n\n## How Version Control Works\n\nThink of versions like save points in a video game - you can always go back to a previous state if something goes wrong.\n\n### Automatic Version Creation\n\nApper creates a new version every time you:\n- Add a new feature or page\n- Modify existing functionality\n- Change design elements or styling\n- Update content or settings\n- Make database structure changes\n\n```\nExample version history:\nv1.0 - Initial app creation: \"Basic booking system\"\nv1.1 - Added feature: \"Email confirmations\"\nv1.2 - Design change: \"Updated color scheme\"\nv1.3 - New feature: \"Customer reviews\"\nv1.4 - Bug fix: \"Fixed mobile menu\"\nv1.5 - Content update: \"New pricing information\"\n```\n\n### Version Naming\n\nApper automatically names versions based on what changed:\n- **Major versions** (1.0, 2.0): Significant new features or complete redesigns\n- **Minor versions** (1.1, 1.2): New features or functionality additions\n- **Patch versions** (1.1.1, 1.1.2): Bug fixes and small improvements\n\n## The Version Dashboard\n\n### Viewing Your Version History\n\nIn the Manage App section, you'll find a complete timeline of your app's evolution:\n\n**Version Information Includes**:\n- Version number and name\n- Date and time of creation\n- Description of changes made\n- Who made the changes (if multiple people have access)\n- Performance metrics for that version\n\n### Version Comparison\n\n```\nCompare any two versions to see:\n📊 What features were added or removed\n🎨 Visual design differences\n📝 Content changes\n⚙️ Settings modifications\n📈 Performance improvements or regressions\n```\n\n## Working with Versions\n\n### Previewing Previous Versions\n\nYou can preview any previous version without affecting your live app:\n\n1. **Select the version** from your history\n2. **Click \"Preview\"** to see how it looked and worked\n3. **Test all features** to remind yourself of that state\n4. **Return to current version** when done exploring\n\n### Restoring a Previous Version\n\nIf you need to go back to an earlier version:\n\n```\nStep-by-step restoration:\n1. Choose the version you want to restore\n2. Click \"Restore This Version\"\n3. Apper creates a new version based on the old one\n4. Your app immediately updates to that state\n5. You can continue working from that point\n```\n\n**Important**: Restoring doesn't delete newer versions - you can always go forward again!\n\n### Creating Manual Snapshots\n\nBefore making major changes, you can create manual snapshots:\n\n```\nWhen to create manual snapshots:\n- Before redesigning your app\n- Prior to adding complex new features\n- When your app is working perfectly and you want to preserve that state\n- Before experimenting with new integrations\n```\n\n## Version Management Strategies\n\n### The Safe Experimentation Approach\n\n```\nBest practice workflow:\n1. Create manual snapshot: \"Working version before redesign\"\n2. Make experimental changes\n3. Test thoroughly\n4. If happy: Continue with new version\n5. If not: Restore to snapshot and try different approach\n```\n\n### Collaborative Version Control\n\nIf multiple people work on your app:\n\n**Version Collaboration Features**:\n- See who made each change\n- Leave notes about why changes were made\n- Lock versions to prevent accidental modifications\n- Set up approval workflows for major changes\n\n### Performance-Based Version Selection\n\n```\nApper tracks performance metrics for each version:\n- Page load speeds\n- User engagement rates\n- Conversion rates\n- Error frequencies\n- Mobile usability scores\n\nYou can restore to versions that performed better!\n```\n\n## Real-World Version Scenarios\n\n### Scenario 1: The Failed Redesign\n\n**Situation**: You redesigned your booking app, but customers are confused by the new layout.\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Check version history to find the last working design\n2. Restore to that version immediately\n3. Your customers can book normally again\n4. Plan a better redesign approach for next time\n\n### Scenario 2: The Accidental Deletion\n\n**Situation**: You accidentally asked Apper to remove a feature you actually needed.\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Find the version before the deletion\n2. Restore that version to get your feature back\n3. Continue from that point with the feature intact\n\n### Scenario 3: A/B Testing\n\n**Situation**: You want to test two different homepage designs.\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Create snapshot of current homepage\n2. Design version A, test with some users\n3. Restore to snapshot\n4. Design version B, test with other users\n5. Compare results and keep the better version\n\n## Advanced Version Features\n\n### Branching (Coming Soon)\n\n```\nFuture feature preview:\n- Create multiple development branches\n- Work on different features simultaneously\n- Merge successful experiments into main app\n- Keep experimental versions separate\n```\n\n### Automated Rollbacks\n\n```\nApper can automatically restore previous versions if:\n- Error rates spike after an update\n- Performance drops significantly\n- User complaints increase\n- Critical features stop working\n```\n\n### Version Analytics\n\n```\nTrack how each version performs:\n📈 User engagement changes\n💰 Revenue impact\n🐛 Bug report frequency\n📱 Mobile usage patterns\n⏱️ Load time variations\n```\n\n## Version Control Best Practices\n\n### Regular Snapshots\n- Create snapshots before major changes\n- Name snapshots descriptively\n- Don't rely only on automatic versions\n- Keep important milestones preserved\n\n### Testing Strategy\n```\nBefore making changes public:\n1. Preview changes in version dashboard\n2. Test on multiple devices\n3. Check all user flows work correctly\n4. Verify integrations still function\n5. Only then make the version live\n```\n\n### Version Cleanup\n- Archive very old versions you'll never need\n- Keep all major milestone versions\n- Document important changes for future reference\n- Regularly review version performance metrics\n\n## The Freedom to Experiment\n\n```\nWith Apper's version control, you can:\n✅ Try bold new features without risk\n✅ Experiment with different designs\n✅ Test controversial changes safely\n✅ Learn from mistakes without consequences\n✅ Always have a working backup\n✅ Collaborate confidently with others\n```\n\nVersion control transforms app development from a risky, irreversible process into a safe playground for innovation. You can push boundaries, try new ideas, and always have the safety net of previous versions to fall back on.\n\nRemember: Every great app is the result of many iterations. Apper's version system makes it easy to iterate quickly and safely, helping you build the best possible app for your users.",

This section is entirely optional and designed for developers who want additional customization options.\n\n## Who Should Use the Code Section?\n\n### Perfect For:\n```\n👨‍💻 Developers who want more control\n🎨 Designers who know CSS and want pixel-perfect styling\n🔧 Technical users who need specific integrations\n📊 Data analysts who want custom tracking\n🚀 Teams migrating from traditional development\n```\n\n### Skip This If:\n```\n🙋‍♀️ You're new to app building\n⏰ You want to focus on business, not code\n🎯 Apper's visual tools meet all your needs\n💼 You prefer no-code solutions\n✨ You want to stay focused on user experience\n```\n\n## What You'll Find in the Code Section\n\n### Generated Code Structure\n\nWhen you look at your app's code, you'll see a well-organized, professional codebase:\n\n**Frontend (React.js)**\n```\nsrc/\n├── components/          # Reusable UI components\n├── pages/              # Individual app pages\n├── styles/             # CSS and styling\n├── utils/              # Helper functions\n├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks\n└── services/           # API communication\n```\n\n**Backend (Node.js)**\n```\nserver/\n├── routes/             # API endpoints\n├── models/             # Database schemas\n├── middleware/         # Authentication, validation\n├── controllers/        # Business logic\n└── config/             # App configuration\n```\n\n### Code Quality Standards\n\n```\nApper generates code that follows:\n✅ Industry best practices\n✅ Clean, readable structure\n✅ Comprehensive comments\n✅ Security standards\n✅ Performance optimization\n✅ Accessibility guidelines\n✅ Mobile responsiveness\n```\n\n## When Code Customization Makes Sense\n\n### Advanced Styling\n\n**CSS Customization**\n```css\n/* Example: Custom animations */\n.custom-button {\n  background: linear-gradient(45deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);\n  transition: all 0.3s ease;\n  transform: translateY(0);\n}\n\n.custom-button:hover {\n  transform: translateY(-2px);\n  box-shadow: 0 10px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\n}\n```\n\n**Advanced Layout Control**\n```css\n/* Example: Custom grid layouts */\n.dashboard-grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));\n  gap: 2rem;\n  align-items: start;\n}\n```\n\n### Custom Business Logic\n\n**Complex Calculations**\n```javascript\n// Example: Custom pricing algorithm\nfunction calculateDynamicPricing(basePrice, demand, seasonality, userTier) {\n  let finalPrice = basePrice;\n  \n  // Demand-based adjustment\n  finalPrice *= (1 + (demand - 0.5) * 0.3);\n  \n  // Seasonal adjustment\n  finalPrice *= seasonality;\n  \n  // User tier discount\n  const discounts = { bronze: 0, silver: 0.05, gold: 0.1, platinum: 0.15 };\n  finalPrice *= (1 - discounts[userTier]);\n  \n  return Math.round(finalPrice * 100) / 100;\n}\n```\n\n### Third-Party Integrations\n\n**API Integrations**\n```javascript\n// Example: Custom analytics integration\nasync function trackCustomEvent(eventName, properties) {\n  try {\n    await fetch('/api/analytics/track', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n      body: JSON.stringify({\n        event: eventName,\n        properties: {\n          ...properties,\n          timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\n          sessionId: getSessionId()\n        }\n      })\n    });\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Analytics tracking failed:', error);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Database Customizations\n\n**Custom Queries**\n```javascript\n// Example: Complex reporting query\nasync function getAdvancedReports(startDate, endDate, filters) {\n  const query = `\n    SELECT \n      DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at) as date,\n      COUNT(*) as bookings,\n      AVG(revenue) as avg_revenue,\n      SUM(revenue) as total_revenue\n    FROM bookings \n    WHERE created_at BETWEEN $1 AND $2\n      AND category = ANY($3)\n    GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at)\n    ORDER BY date DESC\n  `;\n  \n  return await db.query(query, [startDate, endDate, filters.categories]);\n}\n```\n\n## Code Customization Best Practices\n\n### Before You Start Coding\n\n```\nAsk yourself:\n❓ Can I achieve this with Apper's visual tools?\n❓ Will this customization be worth maintaining?\n❓ Does this solve a real user problem?\n❓ Am I optimizing prematurely?\n❓ Will this break when Apper updates?\n```\n\n### Safe Customization Approaches\n\n**1. CSS-Only Changes**\n```css\n/* Safe: Adding custom styles */\n.my-custom-class {\n  /* Your custom styles */\n}\n\n/* Risky: Overriding core Apper styles */\n.apper-generated-class {\n  /* This might break with updates */\n}\n```\n\n**2. Additive JavaScript**\n```javascript\n// Safe: Adding new functionality\nfunction myCustomFeature() {\n  // New code that doesn't modify existing functions\n}\n\n// Risky: Modifying existing Apper functions\nfunction existingApperFunction() {\n  // Modifying this might cause issues\n}\n```\n\n**3. Environment-Specific Code**\n```javascript\n// Safe: Code that only runs in specific environments\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'prod') {\n  // Production-only code\n}\n\nif (window.location.hostname === 'yourdomain.com') {\n  // Production-only code\n}\n```\n\n## Advanced Programming Features\n\n### Custom API Endpoints\n\n```javascript\n// Example: Adding a custom API endpoint\napp.post('/api/custom/advanced-search', async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    const { query, filters, sortBy } = req.body;\n    \n    // Your custom search logic\n    const results = await performAdvancedSearch(query, filters, sortBy);\n    \n    res.json({ success: true, results });\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(500).json({ success: false, error: error.message });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Custom React Components\n\n```javascript\n// Example: Custom dashboard widget\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction CustomAnalyticsWidget({ userId }) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  \n  useEffect(() => {\n    async function fetchData() {\n      try {\n        const response = await fetch(`/api/analytics/${userId}`);\n        const result = await response.json();\n        setData(result);\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error('Failed to fetch analytics:', error);\n      } finally {\n        setLoading(false);\n      }\n    }\n    \n    fetchData();\n  }, [userId]);\n  \n  if (loading) return <div>Loading analytics...</div>;\n  \n  return (\n    <div className=\"analytics-widget\">\n      <h3>Your Performance</h3>\n      <div className=\"metrics\">\n        <div className=\"metric\">\n          <span className=\"value\">{data.totalBookings}</span>\n          <span className=\"label\">Total Bookings</span>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"metric\">\n          <span className=\"value\">${data.totalRevenue}</span>\n          <span className=\"label\">Revenue</span>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default CustomAnalyticsWidget;\n```\n\n### Custom Hooks\n\n```javascript\n// Example: Custom hook for complex state management\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction useAdvancedBookingState(initialBookings = []) {\n  const [bookings, setBookings] = useState(initialBookings);\n  const [filters, setFilters] = useState({});\n  const [sortBy, setSortBy] = useState('date');\n  \n  const filteredBookings = useMemo(() => {\n    let filtered = bookings;\n    \n    // Apply filters\n    if (filters.status) {\n      filtered = filtered.filter(b => b.status === filters.status);\n    }\n    \n    if (filters.dateRange) {\n      filtered = filtered.filter(b => {\n        const bookingDate = new Date(b.date);\n        return bookingDate >= filters.dateRange.start && \n               bookingDate <= filters.dateRange.end;\n      });\n    }\n    \n    // Apply sorting\n    filtered.sort((a, b) => {\n      switch (sortBy) {\n        case 'date':\n          return new Date(b.date) - new Date(a.date);\n        case 'revenue':\n          return b.revenue - a.revenue;\n        default:\n          return 0;\n      }\n    });\n    \n    return filtered;\n  }, [bookings, filters, sortBy]);\n  \n  return {\n    bookings: filteredBookings,\n    setBookings,\n    filters,\n    setFilters,\n    sortBy,\n    setSortBy\n  };\n}\n\nexport default useAdvancedBookingState;\n```\n\n## Programming Workflow\n\n### Version Control Integration\n\n```\nApper supports:\n✅ Git repository connections\n✅ Branch-based programming\n✅ Code review workflows\n✅ Automated deployment\n✅ Rollback capabilities\n```\n\n### Testing and Debugging\n\n```javascript\n// Example: Custom testing utilities\nfunction createTestBooking(overrides = {}) {\n  return {\n    id: Math.random().toString(36),\n    customerName: 'Test Customer',\n    service: 'Test Service',\n    date: new Date().toISOString(),\n    status: 'confirmed',\n    revenue: 100,\n    ...overrides\n  };\n}\n\n// Example: Debug logging\nfunction debugLog(message, data = null) {\n  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'prod') {\n    console.group(`🐛 ${message}`);\n    if (data) console.log(data);\n    console.trace();\n    console.groupEnd();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Common Code Customization Scenarios\n\n### Scenario 1: Custom Reporting Dashboard\n\n```\nRequirement: Complex business intelligence dashboard\n\nSolution:\n1.

Create custom React components for complex features\n```\n\n## When NOT to Use Code Customization\n\n### Avoid Custom Code For:\n\n```\n❌ Basic styling changes (use visual editor)\n❌ Simple business logic (use Apper's built-in tools)\n❌ Standard integrations (check if Apper supports it)\n❌ Common app features (Apper likely has it built-in)\n❌ Quick experiments (start with visual tools)\n```\n\n### Red Flags:\n\n```\n🚩 Rewriting large portions of generated code\n🚩 Fighting against Apper's architecture\n🚩 Custom code that duplicates existing features\n🚩 Modifications that break mobile responsiveness\n🚩 Changes that compromise security\n```\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nThe Code section is a powerful tool for developers who need it, but remember:\n\n```\n✅ Start with Apper's visual tools\n✅ Only add custom code when necessary\n✅ Keep customizations minimal and focused\n✅ Document your changes thoroughly\n✅ Test extensively across devices\n✅ Consider maintenance overhead\n```\n\nMost successful Apper apps never need custom code. The visual tools are powerful enough to handle 95% of use cases. But when you do need that extra 5% of customization, the Code section gives you the flexibility to build exactly what you envision.\n\nRemember: The best code is often no code at all. Use Apper's visual tools first, and only dive into custom code when you've exhausted the no-code options.",

    "content": "# Database Setup: The Foundation of Your App\n\nEvery great app needs a solid database foundation. Apper automatically creates and manages your database, but understanding how it works helps you make better decisions about your app's structure and user permissions.\n\n## Automatic Database Magic\n\nOne of Apper's most powerful features is intelligent database creation. When you describe your app, Apper doesn't just build the interface - it designs the perfect database structure to support your functionality.\n\n### What Apper Creates Automatically\n\n**Core System Tables**\n```\n👥 Users table\n- User accounts and profiles\n- Authentication information\n- Preferences and settings\n- Registration and login data\n\n🔐 Permissions table\n- User roles and access levels\n- Feature-specific permissions\n- Administrative privileges\n- Security settings\n\n📧 Communications table\n- Email history and templates\n- Notification preferences\n- Message logs and delivery status\n- Unsubscribe management\n```\n\n**App-Specific Tables**\n```\nFor a booking app, Apper creates:\n📅 Bookings table (reservation data)\n🏢 Services table (available services)\n⏰ Time_slots table (availability)\n💳 Payments table (transaction records)\n⭐ Reviews table (customer feedback)\n\nFor an e-commerce app:\n🛍️ Products table (inventory)\n🛒 Orders table (purchase records)\n📦 Shipments table (delivery tracking)\n💰 Transactions table (payment history)\n🎯 Categories table (product organization)\n```\n\n### Intelligent Relationships\n\nApper automatically creates the connections between different pieces of data:\n\n```\nSmart relationship examples:\n👤 Users → Bookings (who made what reservation)\n📅 Bookings → Services (what was booked)\n💳 Bookings → Payments (billing information)\n⭐ Users → Reviews (who wrote which review)\n🏢 Services → Reviews (reviews for each service)\n```\n\n## The Two App Types\n\nApper categorizes apps into two main types, each with different database permission structures:\n\n### Employee-Facing Apps (Internal Tools)\n\n**Characteristics**:\n```\n👥 Used by your team/employees\n🏢 Internal business processes\n🔒 Higher security requirements\n📊 Administrative and management features\n💼 Professional workflows\n```\n\n**Database Permissions**:\n```\n🔧 Admins can:\n✅ View all data across the organization\n✅ Modify any records

they're responsible for\n✅ Create new records within their scope\n❌ Cannot access confidential data\n❌ Cannot modify system settings\n```\n\n**Example: HR Management System**\n```\nPermission structure:\n👑 HR Director: Full access to all employee data\n👤 HR Coordinator: Access to non-confidential employee info\n📊 Department Manager: Access to their team's data\n👥 Employee: Access to their own information only\n```\n\n### Customer-Facing Apps (External Users)\n\n**Characteristics**:\n```\n🌍 Used by your customers/public\n🛡️ Privacy-focused permissions\n👥 User-specific data isolation\n🔒
